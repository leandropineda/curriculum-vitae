%New Lines and Paragraphs
%\begin{detail}
%\SubBulletItem
%To create a new line within the same paragraph (i.e., with the same indentation), use \CodeCommand{newline} instead of \CodeCommand{\textbackslash}.
%The latter will not work because it breaks the long table.
%\SubBulletItem
%To create a new paragraph, use \CodeCommand{par} or simply leave an empty line.
%Paragraph indentations (from
%\CodeCommand{Item},
%\CodeCommand{SubItem},
%\CodeCommand{BulletItem},
%\CodeCommand{SubBulletItem},
%etc.) do not carry across different paragraphs.
